  <p>In my pursuit of new opportunities, I was excited to find the Product Design (UI/UX) opportunity with your company. As a product design with 2+ years of experience working and tutoring for organizations, I am able to boost your audience’s
    interest in your website and products related.
    <br>
    At Datafix, I was in charge of Graphic Design tutoring with the use of Photoshop, Figma and CorelDraw and also in charge of PowerPoint Presentation tutorials.
    I have also done lots of additional training on products Design also in details on Web/Mobile front-end design and mobile Apps.
    I also have the skill of advance video editing with Aftereffect using Adobe Premier pro and AfterEffects.
    I have attended a Higher School of Art and Design in Nigeria but due to some circumstance, I couldn’t finish the program and this shows my passion of designing.
